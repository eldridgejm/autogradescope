# autogradescope

*autogradescope* is a simple python testing framework for building informative
Gradescope autograders, based on pytest. The framework prints friendly error
messages when a test case fails, an exception was raised, or a file is missing.
It also provides useful autograder functionality, such as a timeout decorator
for tests.
